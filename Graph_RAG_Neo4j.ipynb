As a result, there is a need to both reduce andstructure this data so it can be analyzed meaningfully. The analysis necessary tocreateÐbusinessintelligenceÑfromthecollectedrawdatarequiresavariedtoolset.To set the stage, lets first define business intelligence generically. In a Googlesearch for business intelligence, http://whatis.techtarget.com/attributed the termbusiness intelligence to a September, 1996 Gartner Group report:ÐBusiness intelligence (BI) is a broad category of applications and technologies\n",
      "for gathering, storing, analyzing, and providing access to data to help enterpriseusers make better business decisions. BI applications include the activities ofdecisionsupport systems, query an d rep orting, online analytical processing(OLAP), statistical analysis, forecasting, and Data Mining.ÑFor the generic definition of a Data Warehouse, I think we need to give the creditto one of the gurus of Data Warehousing ÐBill InmonÑ. In 1990 Mr. Inmondefined a Data Warehouse as follows:In1990,BillInmondefinedaDataWarehou se: ÐAwarehouseisasubject-oriented,integrated, time-variant and non-volatile collection of data in support of\"management's decision making process .Ñ\"Amoretechnicaldefinitionmightbe: thesubsetofaBusinessIntelligencetoolsetresponsible for modeling, structuring, storing as well as extraction translation andloading (ETL) of the underlying data needed for analysis.So in summary, Business Intelligence software is the collection of applications\n",
      "needed to make sense of business data. The Data Warehouse, a component ofthis Business Intelligence tool set, is the more specific tool responsible for thecleanup, loading, and storage of the data needed by the business. Although wewill address the overall BI tool set in the next lesson, this class focuses on theData Warehouse component.A Data Warehouse can help to organize the data. It brings together all operativeDataSources(thesearemostlyheterogeneousandhavedifferingdegreesofdetail).The job of the warehouse is to provide this data ina usable form to the wholeorganization.

Kimball, another guru of Data Warehousing, defines a Data Warehouse as .9Acopy of transaction data, specially restructured for queries and analyses.Ñ ( TheData Warehouse Toolkit , 1996, page 310).BusinessIntelligenceSystemsObjectivesAmodern Business Intelligence system must meet the following requirements:\n",
